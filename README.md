# Wire Tracer

A WireShark clone that aims to optimize the functionality of WireShark by adding
anomaly detectors and alerting the user via the frontend or email.

## Features

- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies suspicious packet behaviors and flags
  potential issues.
- **Alert System**:
  - **Frontend Notifications**: Alerts users directly on the interface if they
    are actively monitoring.
  - **Email Notifications**: Sends alerts to the user's email when they are away
    from their machine.
- **Malicious Packet Detection**: Detects and highlights packets that appear
  malicious based on predefined rules.
- **Domain Monitoring**: Flags suspicious unofficial domains in packet data for
  further investigation.

## Goals

Wire Tracer aims to make packet analysis more efficient and user-friendly by
integrating proactive alerts and additional security measures into traditional
packet capturing functionality.
